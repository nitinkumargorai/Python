# index means a kind of position number 
# like if we take one example "HORSE" then the indexing is like 0,1,2,3,4 -> H,O,R,S,E

# LET DO IT

animal = "HORSE"
ch0 =animal[0] #H
ch1 = animal[1] #O

#now we print our indexing value 
print(ch0)
print(ch1)

#we can't change the value of item , using indexing
# like this

# ch[4] = "n"
# print(ch)
