#when we use double, single , triple quotes while defining a value in any variable it will be a string ("",'', """ """)

#here is an example

str = 'This is a string which is created by single quote'
str2 = "This is a string which is created by double quotes"
str3 = """This is a string which is created by triple quotes"""

print(str)

#operation in Python

a = "Nitin"
b = "Kumar"
final= a + b

# 2. Length of String
print(len(a))
