#we are taking two variable to get input from user for calculation

num1 = int(input("Enter your First Number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter your Second Number: "))

#now we are creating a variable which give the sum of two number
sum = num1 + num2

#now we simply print the variable sum to giving the sum of two numbers:

print("The sum of two numbers is: ", sum)
